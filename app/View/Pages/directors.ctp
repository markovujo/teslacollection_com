	<p>Iwona Rudinska speaks five languages and, trained as a nurse in Poland, immigrated to America as a 20 year old.  By age 35 she was an American citizen, had five children and directed and edited several documentaries including a video on the life and work of Nikola Tesla.  This Tesla documentary sparked her interest in the inventor and, after four years of research and a great deal of work, finally produced The Tesla Collection.  The eclectic Ms. Rodinska also paints and some of her work can be found on her website: http://rudinska.com/index.html.</p>
